## Description

Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.

Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

#### Example 1:

Input: nums = [10,2]

Output: "210"

#### Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,30,34,5,9]

Output: "9534330"
